    Implement prefixAverages1 and prefixAverages2 and perform an 
experimental analysis of their running time using multiple array 
(vector) sizes.  

    Discuss (write a paragraph) and graph (with a trend line) your 
results of your experiments quantitatively (don’t use words like 
“significantly larger, various, slower, etc.).  If your times for
your experiment do not make sense, count the number of executable
statements.  You should not just state the Big-oh analysis.
Output the first four values of the input and output arrays 
(vectors) to verify the algorithms.  Do not compare prefixAverages1
and prefixAverages2.  Do not address coding features.

Work with a different partner from Labs 1 and 2.  
Due January 27th
